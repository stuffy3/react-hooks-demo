Why Hooks
    Don't need classes so you don't need to bind anything
    No particular way to reuse stateful component logic
    HOC and render props patterns do not address the problem
    Makes code harder to follow
    Better wat to share stateful logic
    create components for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing to events
    Datafetching used componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
    Event listeners used componentDidMount and componentWillMount
Summary
    Use react features without having to write classes
    avoid using and confusing the 'this' keyword
    allow you to reuse stateful logic
    Organize the logic inside a component into reusavle isolated units

UseState()
